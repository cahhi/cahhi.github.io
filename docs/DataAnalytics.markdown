I earned my Business Analytics Nanodegree in August 2025 from Udacity where I worked with Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, MySQL and Tableau. I was able to complete a series of projects to showcase all that I had learned. 


<u>**Title: NYSE Data Project**</u>

In this Excel/Google Sheets project, I was tasked with looking at data from the New York Stock Exchange and forming a question that can be answered by organizing and placing the data in a visualization. I asked the question: "Which sub-industry in the consumer discretionary sector had the highest total revenue in a 4 year period?, and showed the data through a bar chart and an explanation in a slide.

<u>**Title: Flight Cancellations - Data Visualizations**</u>

In this Tableau project, I was given a data set that coincided with Flight Cancellations in 2015. I was tasked with choosing four questions that I could answer using the dataset and creating visualizations in order to display the data.
