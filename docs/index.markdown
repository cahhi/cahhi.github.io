Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Chrissy Holmes, an inspiring data analysts with experince in Java, JavaScript, MySQL, and Tableau. I've contributed to many projects alone and with other inspiring developers. I love working with data and being on the backend trying to solve problems by looking for patterns and making sure to keep customers happy. I am seeking a role that will allow me to showcase these skills as well as launch my career. Please dive into my portfolio, take a look around, and I hope to hear from you soon!
