Welcome!

My name is Chrissy Rodgers, an inspiring software developer with experince in Java, JavaScript, and MySQL and I've contributed to many projects alone and with other inspiring developers. I love working with data and being on the backend trying to solve problems by looking for patterns and making sure to keep customers happy. I am seeking a role that will allow me to showcase these skills as well as launch my career. Please dive into my portfolio, take a look around, and I hope to hear from you soon!
